&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
A set of tools to make handling forbidden items easier.

&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
The tools are located in the Architect menu, under the Orders tab. Hovering over each tool shows what it does and how to use it.

Each tool can also be selected with a hotkey without opening the menu. See the Keyboard configuration panel in the options menu to customize the hotkeys.
