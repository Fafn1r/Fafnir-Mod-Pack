[center][size=20pt]Crash Landing[/size][/center]

[color=orange][size=18pt]Description:[/size][/color]
This mod changes the game start. It adds a new event, that drop a different spaceship parts on the landing site from the sky. Pods with colonists, containers with resources, engines with flammable fuel, and other useful and dangerous things. This event triggers at the start of the game, so your arrival will be much more similar to the movie crash landing. With the fire, explosions, dead and wounded people.

You will need to organize the rescue of wounded colonists and supplies. The fire will be your main enemy. It will start as small fires on the impact tiles, but quickly grow in major fire. Beat the small fires or evacuate supplies. Watch out for other dangers.

This mod tries to add a new gameplay, when you need to choose between resources and wounded peoples. And may be between wounded and maimed.

There are two scenarios: Easy and Hard
    In Easy scenario, you start with 3 healthy colonists and standard equipment. While some more random colonists will be crash-landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.
    In Hard scenario, your starting colonists and equipment will crash land and take severe damage. Then, some more random colonists will be crash-landing hard with little chance of surviving the impact.

You should start the new game only with one of the CrashLanding scenarios. Otherwise you will have no CrashLanding, only random ship crashes as minor events.

If you you make new scenario by editing CrashLanding scenarios, it will have crashlanding event at the start. That mean, you can add various scenario parts through in-game editor, without breaking CrashLanding.

[color=red][size=18pt]Important uninstall issue:[/size][/color]
Since you can create your own scenario by editing one of the crashlanding scenarios, you need to delete all such scenarios manually, before uninstalling the crashlanding. Otherwise the game fails to start any new game.

- Added new random crashes... It is not what you thinking about. It is a new event, that can happen during the game, when different small spaceships crashlands near your colony.
- Reworked parts generation algorithm.
- Created templates for crashlanding events. Templates are used for parts generation and located in CrashLanding\defs\CrashTemplateDefs\.

- This mod can work alone, as it was earlie. But no crashlanding for starting colonists.
- Reactor still very dangerous, but get a new feature: It produces power! You can connect crashed reactor to your power net and get free energy. Of course, for a price of safety.
