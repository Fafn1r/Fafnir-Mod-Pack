  <description>Gives the camera tracking capabilities. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Press the ‘Home’ key (default, can be changed with in-game keybinding settings) while any colonist, enemy, animal or item is selected, and the camera will follow them (including furniture and plants - but they tend to not move much). Alternatively, you can right click colonists in the Colonist Bar on top of the screen to toggle following.

&lt;b&gt;Does not require a new save game&lt;/b&gt;
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves.
