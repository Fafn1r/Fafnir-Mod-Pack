IMPORTANT NOTE: Almost all mods used in my mod pack have been made by other authors - you are NOT ALLOWED to modify or redistribute them, unless you have author's permission or their licenses say so.

You can do whatever you want with my own changes, as long as you mention who made them and inform me before. Authors of mods modified by me are free to use my changes to their mods without notice, although it would be nice to contact me first, too.

You are not allowed to redistribute Fafnir Mod Pack or host it anywhere without my permission.
