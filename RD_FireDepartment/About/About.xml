Adds 3 items:

* Fire extinguisher - close range, fast, weak
* Firefoam grenades - medium range, slow, moderate strength
* Doomsday firefoam capsule launcher - long range, huge area, strong, single use

All can be crafted at the machining table or bought from exotic traders. Firefoam is a required research to craft them.

Special thanks to Nattiejim for the firefoam grenades code. I have borrowed it in its entirety and used it as a reference to create the extinguisher and launcher.</description>
