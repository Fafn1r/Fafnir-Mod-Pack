# Fafnir Mod Pack

Here's a collection of mods I use, packed into a mod pack, with permissions and stuff. Be warned - it leans heavily on Combat Realism. I'm aiming to add more stuff, more choices and more features that make the game harder, but without adding too much complexity or redundant things.

I'd like to thank all mod authors whose mods made it to FMP. Without you it wouldn't be complete. :D

IMPORTANT NOTE: I consider this mod pack incomplete without a mod that adds more guns. Until I get permission for one, you can use CR compatibile version of Rimfire or RT's Weapon Pack. Just add it below Combat Realism in the load order.


Installation:

1. Delete .../Users/[your name]/AppData/LocalLow/Ludeon Studios/ folder. Or don't, if you know what you are doing.
2. Unsubscribe from all mods in Steam Workshop.
3. Delete all mods from .../Steam/steamapps/common/Rimworld/Mods folder, but [color=red]LEAVE CORE FOLDER AS IT IS[/color].
4. Download FMP and unpack it to .../Steam/steamapps/common/Rimworld/Mods folder.
5. Move ModsComfig.xml to .../Users/[your name]/AppData/LocalLow/Ludeon Studios/Rimworld by Ludeon Studios/Config folder


FAQ:

Q: Can you add a version without Combat Realism/ammo system?
A: [color=red]NO[/color]
Q: Can you add mod X?
A: If I'd like to used it, yes. If I don't, but many people would like to use it and it can be disabled/skipped (like Prepare Carefully), yes. Otherwise no.
Q: X mod just got updated, can you add new version?
A: Unless it's a gamebreaking bug hotfix, it has to wait until next FMP release. I won't be adding significiant changes mid-playthrough.
Q: Can I add more mods to FMP?
A: Do it at your own risk. Some mods may be incompatibile with others and I only make compatibility patches for mods in FMP.
Q: Can I safely disable some mods from FMP?
A: Some, yes. Some, no. I added more dependencies - for example you won't be able to make MoreFloors wool carpets, if you disable Vegetable Garden, because it uses Tailor's Loom.
