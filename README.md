# Fafnir Mod Pack

Here's a collection of mods I use, around 90 mods packed into a mod pack, with permissions and stuff. My aim is to add more stuff, more choices and more features that make the game harder, but without adding too much complexity or redundant things. Be warned - it leans heavily on Combat Realism.

I'd like to thank all mod authors whose mods made it to FMP. Without you it wouldn't be complete. :D

I'm especially interested in your feedback if you are playing on biomes other than desert, because that's where I exclusively play - I don't know what's the balance on tundra or ice sheet.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I consider this mod pack incomplete without a mod that adds more guns. Until I get permission for one, you can use CR compatibile version of Rimfire or RT's Weapon Pack. Just add it below Combat Realism in the load order.

Next big release will be 1.0 with a few more mods and a huge balance pass.

FAQ:

Q: Can you add a version without Combat Realism/ammo system?

A: NO

Q: Can you add mod X?

A: If I'd like to used it, yes. If I don't, but many people would like to use it and it can be disabled/skipped (like Prepare Carefully), yes. Otherwise no.

Q: X mod just got updated, can you add new version?

A: Unless it's a gamebreaking bug hotfix, it has to wait until next FMP release. I won't be adding significiant changes mid-playthrough.

Q: Can I add more mods to FMP?

A: Do it at your own risk. Some mods may be incompatibile with others and I only make compatibility patches for mods in FMP.

Q: Can I safely disable some mods from FMP?

A: Some, yes. Some, no. I added more dependencies - for example you won't be able to make MoreFloors wool carpets, if you disable Vegetable Garden, because it uses Tailor's Loom.

Q: There's something weird happening with pawns picking up and dropping stuff. What's going on?

A: Learn to use loadout system in the Assign tab. Create new loadouts and assign them to pawns. Make sure to add ammo, if you are adding a gun/bow and always add one meal, the one you are regularly cooking.

Q: Why cantipedes can't be killed? I'm not even scratching them!

A: Use explosives, EMP and AP ammo. Mostly explosives.

Current issues:

1. Material properties, food nutrition, power usage, mass, bulk, research tree and other things have not been rebalanced yet.
2. Miniaturisation needs some changes. I'd like to hear your feedback - do you want to be able to move everything or should we make it more realistic? With added mass and bulk realistic approach sounds much better to me.
3. Combat Realism supression mechanics are missing. :(
4. Reasearch tree needs more work.

License:

Mods contained in FMP are under their own licenses - you can't reupload or publicly modify them, unless you have author's permission or the license says so.

My changes and additions can be used as you like, although it would be nice to mention who made them and contact me first.

Don't reupload the mod pack anywhere.

Mod authors are welcome to take my bugfixes and compatibility patches for their mods as they like.
