  <description>Adds extra functionality to the Animals tab 

&lt;size=24&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;
Does not require a new save game. 
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;
First released back in A12 (or was it 11?) this mod vastly improved the vanilla animals tab. Evidently, Tynan agreed and the mod is now (mostly) part of the vanilla game. I still feel this mod looks better, and adds enough extra functionality (sorting, filters, renaming) to make it a worthwhile replacement. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Gender and lifestage icons on the animals tab. Easily keep track of your chickenfarm! 
Butchery designation right from the animals tab. 
Sort by name, gender, lifestage/age, and bodysize (meat). 
Filter by race, and a variety of attributes. 
Rename (named) pets. Donâ€™t like the name Buttercup for your Warg? Change it! 
Mass assign masters, or assign all to bonded masters.
