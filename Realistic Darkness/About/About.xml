  <description>This mod changes lighting and saturation in rimworld to be dynamically darker. This mod overrides your vanilla weather definitions (Could not be avoided, this was not elective)
Includes:
-Daylight remains unchanged but weather patterns have a stronger effect on light levels even during daylight hours.
-Nights are considerably darker.
-Night darkness changes dynamically with weather conditions:
	+Hard/Gentle snow are the lightest nights
	+Dry thunderstorms are only slightly darker than clear nights.
	+Foggy Rain is the darkest. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE AREAS UNLIT BY TORCHES/LIGHTS DURING THIS WEATHER PATTERN.
-Saturation (color strength) changes more dynamically in response to weather.
-Movespeed and ranged accuracy are very close to vanilla values. Hard snow and foggy rain are harshest on accuracy and movement (foggy rain movement is same as rain).
-Eclipses are now as dark as clear nights.
