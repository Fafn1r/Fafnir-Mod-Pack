  <description>Spruce up your colonists' bedrooms with a selection of different colours for all sizes of bed. Compatible with Anonemous2's More Furniture mod - added beds will receive rest bonuses from bedroom furniture.

‚óè Beds of all sizes now have red, yellow, green, blue, and purple variants

Note: Don't enable this mod as well as T-MoreBedsCloth; just pick one.
Note: Beds added by this mod do not recolour when set to prisoner or medical use. Vanilla beds still recolour normally.</description>
