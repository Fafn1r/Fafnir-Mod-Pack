	Get your butt off the planet in style ;)
	
	This Mod does override some vanilla objects!!!
	(ship beam, cryo casket of the ship menu)
	
	- adds additional (most purely cosmetic) ship parts to the game
	- your ship still needs to have the vanilla parts needed to fly somewhere (enigne,reactor,computer,filled cryocasket)
	- overrides the vanilla ship beam with a linkable variant like walls work(same costs like vanilla beam in the end)
	- overrides the vanilla cryocasket in the ship menu to set the interaction spot in the object and remove the placeworks that forces you to put it on a beam (for better building)
